## **Introduction**

This repository is part of a challenge involving the automation of tests using Jenkins and Jest. Initially, I encountered several issues with the provided Jenkins server, which was very limited and partially broken. After installing the Docker Pipeline plugin, nothing worked as expected, which led me to switch to my personal Jenkins server: [jenkins.rondon.cloud](https://jenkins.rondon.cloud/job/FilteredAi/), specifically the `FilteredAi` project.

Additionally, I uploaded the adjusted code to a personal repository with altered names to avoid search engines indexing the content and to prevent affecting the original `FilteredAi` challenge. You can find the modified repository here: [TestTemp](https://github.com/DanielRondonGarcia/TestTemp).

I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused, but I had to present a working solution.
